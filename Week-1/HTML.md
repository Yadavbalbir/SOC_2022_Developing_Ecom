## HTML Tutorial <a name = "html"></a> 

### What is HTML?
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


### Basic structure of HTML Document 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```

Everytime you want to make webpages, you will have to write this basic syntex. Everything that will be visible on the website will be written inside `<body>` tag. 

**Important Note** 
It is not important to memorize syntex. Syntex can be viewed on google in just one search. But it is really important to understand the structure, concept and what is used to build your requirement. Suppose I want to create a form where users can enter their details like name, address, email etc. You can easily get syntex for making form in just one search. But what you must understand or I would say you must know that there is a specific way to make forms in Html and you must be familiar with it.
